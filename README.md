# Exploring Evictions and Code Violations in Philadelphia

### Description
In this analysis, I explored the spatial trends of evictions in Philadelphia. I also explored the idea that evictions can occur as retaliation against renters for reporting code violations. Spatial correlations between evictions and code violations from the City's Licenses and Inspections department can offer some insight into this question.
